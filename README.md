#### Disclaimer
It is my sincere intend to be as open and forthcoming as I can be, and therefore to do my utmost best to share my scripts whenever is possible.

#### This repository
This repositories contains scripts organized in folders for published projects (as of November 22, 2017). All scripts are annotated for debugging purposes - and future reference. Therefore, most scripts will be self-explanatory and this page only serves as a table of contents.

#### EGA
All (raw) genotype and methylation data will be made available through EGA. 

#### Notes
Scripts will work within the context of a certain Linux environment, for example a CentOS7 system on a SUN Grid Engine background or macOS X Lion+ (version 10.7.[x]+).

### CTMM: eQTL analysis in monocytes

[add in texts]

For the eQTL analyses in monocytes from CTMM we developed the [QTLToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/QTLToolKit) which is using [QTLTools](https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/).

### Meta-analysis of GWAS for serum FABP4 levels

[add in texts]

For this meta-analysis we redesigned and updated MANTEL (see [here](http://debakker.med.harvard.edu/resources.html) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18852200)) and created [MetaGWASToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/MetaGWASToolKit) to this end. **MetaGWASToolKit** works with 1000G data (phase 1 and phase 3) as well as the Dutch 'optimized' reference 1000G+GoNL5.

## 2017

### Smoking is associated to DNA methylation in atherosclerotic carotid lesions.

[add in texts]

For the mQTL analyses in the [Athero-Express](http://www.atheroexpress.nl) I developed the [fastQTLToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/fastQTLToolKit) which is using [fastQTL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26708335).
All (raw) genotype and methylation data will be made available soon via EGA; a link is supplied above. For access to BiKE and STAGE data contact with the respective 'owners' should be made.

Link to the publication: revision is submitted; link follows [asap].


### CVD loci

For this I used mainly [GWASToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/GWASToolKit). Some additional useful scripts I used are found in the [HerculesToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/HerculesToolKit). The polygenic (risk) scores were made with a script we (Jessica van Setten and I) had gotten via Eli Stahl. All (raw) genotype data will be made available soon via EGA; a link is supplied above.
