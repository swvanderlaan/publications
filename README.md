#### Disclaimer
It is my sincere intend to be as open and forthcoming as I can be, and therefore to do my utmost best to share my scripts whenever is possible. 

#### This repository
This repositories contains scripts organized in folders for published projects (as of August 30, 2016). All scripts are annotated for debugging purposes - and future reference. Therefore, most scripts will be self-explanatory and this page only serves as a table of contents.

#### EGA
All (raw) genotype and methylation data will be made available through EGA. When the EGA-identifiers are known, I will put them here.

#### Notes
Scripts will work within the context of a certain Linux environment, for example a CentOS7 system on a SUN Grid Engine background or macOS X Lion+ (version 10.7.[x]+).

## 2018

### [CTMM: eQTL analysis in monocytes](2018/ctmm)

[more information to follow]

For the eQTL analyses in monocytes from CTMM we developed the [QTLToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/QTLToolKit) which is using [QTLTools](https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/).

### [Meta-analysis of GWAS for serum FABP4 levels](2018/fabp4)

[more information to follow]

For this meta-analysis we redesigned and updated MANTEL (see [here](http://debakker.med.harvard.edu/resources.html) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18852200)) and created [MetaGWASToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/MetaGWASToolKit) to this end. **MetaGWASToolKit** works with 1000G data (phase 1 and phase 3) as well as the Dutch 'optimized' reference 1000G+GoNL5.

## 2017

### [Smoking is associated to DNA methylation in atherosclerotic carotid lesions.](2017/smoking_ewas/)

For this study we performed an **E**pigenome-**W**ide **A**ssociation **S**tudy (EWAS) of DNA derived from whole-blood and carotid plaques.

### [CVD loci](2017/cvd_loci)

For this I used mainly [GWASToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/GWASToolKit). Some additional useful scripts I used are found in the [HerculesToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/HerculesToolKit). The polygenic (risk) scores were made with a script we (Jessica van Setten and I) had gotten via Eli Stahl. All (raw) genotype data will be made available soon via EGA; a link is supplied above.

## 2016

### [Cystatin C and Cardiovascular Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.](2016/cystatin_c_power/)

The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomization to investigate whether cystatin C is causally related to CVD in the general population. We published this in [JACC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27561768).
