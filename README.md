Publications
============

This repositories contains scripts organized in folders for published projects (as of November 22, 2017). All scripts are annotated for debugging purposes - and future reference. Therefore, most scripts will be self-explanatory and this page only serves as a table of contents.

Scripts will work within the context of a certain Linux environment, for example a CentOS7 system on a SUN Grid Engine background or macOS X Lion+ (version 10.7.[x]+).
