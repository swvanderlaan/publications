This repositories contains scripts organized in folders for published projects (as of November 22, 2017). All scripts are annotated for debugging purposes - and future reference. Therefore, most scripts will be self-explanatory and this page only serves as a table of contents.

Scripts will work within the context of a certain Linux environment, for example a CentOS7 system on a SUN Grid Engine background or macOS X Lion+ (version 10.7.[x]+).

### Smoking is associated to DNA methylation in atherosclerotic carotid lesions.

[add in texts]

Raw genotype and methylation data will be made available soon via EGA. For access to BiKE and STAGE data contact with the respective 'owners' should be made.

Link to the publication: revision is submitted; link follows [asap].


### CVD loci

For this I used mainly [GWASToolKit](). Some additional useful scripts I used are found in the [HerculesToolKit](). The polygenic (risk) scores were made with a script we (Jessica van Setten and I) had gotten via Eli Stahl. Raw genotype data will be made available soon via EGA.
