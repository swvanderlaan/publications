#### Abstract

**Background** Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling is implicated in atherosclerosis, however the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of common genetic variants in _OSM_ and its receptors, _OSMR_ and _LIFR_, on overall plaque vulnerability (based on macrophage, collagen, smooth muscle cell and fat content) and on seven individual atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes (calcification, collagen, atheroma size, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, vessel density and intraplaque hemorrhage).

**Methods and results** We queried Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and selected one variant, rs13168867 (C allele), that associated with decreased _OSMR_ expression and one variant, rs10491509 (A allele), that associated with increased _LIFR_ expression in arterial tissue. No variant was associated to significantly altered _OSM_ expression.

We associated these two variants with plaque characteristics from 1,443 genotyped carotid endarterectomy patients in the Athero-Express Biobank Study. The rs13168867 variant in _OSMR_ was significantly associated with an increased overall plaque vulnerability (β = 0.118 ± s.e. = 0.040, p = 3.00×2−3, C allele). With respect to different plaque phenotypes, this variant showed strongest associations with intraplaque fat (β = 0.248 ± s.e. = 0.088, p = 4.66×2−3, C allele) and collagen content (β = −0.259 ± s.e. = 0.095, p = 6.22×2−3, C allele). No associations were found for rs10491509 in the _LIFR_ locus.

**Conclusion** Our study suggests that genetically decreased arterial _OSMR_ expression, possibly resulting in decreased OSM signaling, contributes to increased carotid plaque vulnerability.
